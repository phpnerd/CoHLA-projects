# Chapter 3. Co-simulation

This chapter describes a co-simulation of room model and a thermostat model.
For the co-simulation, the [Portico](https://github.com/openlvc/portico) implementation of the HLA standard is used, for which also a library is included in the repository.
GUIs for both the thermostat and the room are created using JavaFX.
