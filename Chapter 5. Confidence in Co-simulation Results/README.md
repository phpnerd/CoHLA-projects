### Chapter 5. Confidence in Co-simulation Results

This chapter describes a number of experiments to raise the confidence in the co-simulation results from CoHLA co-simulations.
The experiments with the lookahead value are hard to reproduce since this requires the CoHLA libraries to be changed.
These results are included in the *results* folder.
The results of the results comparisons between the 20-sim simulation and the CoHLA co-simulation are included as well as the results comparison between the SingleWatertank system.

All models are included in the *models* folder and the CoHLA specifications are located in the *sources* folder.
