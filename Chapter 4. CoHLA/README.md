### Chapter 4. CoHLA

This chapter describes [CoHLA](https://github.com/phpnerd/CoHLA), a DSL that was developed to rapidly construct a co-simulation from a set of simulation models.
For the co-simulation, the [OpenRTI](https://sourceforge.net/p/openrti/wiki/Home/) implementation of the HLA standard is used.
The RoomThermostat example is included in this directory as CoHLA source files and the models of the thermostat and the room.
The results as shown in the thesis are included as well.
